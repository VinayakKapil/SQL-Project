# Use a CTE (a Common Table Expression) and a SUM() function in the SELECT statement in a query to find out how many male employees have never signed a contract with a salary value higher than or equal to the all-time company salary average.


##  2:
# Use a CTE (a Common Table Expression) and (at least one) COUNT() function in the SELECT statement of a query to find out how many male employees have never signed a contract with a salary value higher than or equal to the all-time company salary average.


##  3:
# Use MySQL joins (and donâ€™t use a Common Table Expression) in a query to find out how many male employees have never signed a contract with a salary value higher than or equal to the all-time company salary average (i.e. to obtain the same result as in the previous exercise).


##  4:
# Use a cross join in a query to find out how many male employees have never signed a contract with a salary value higher than or equal to the all-time company salary average (i.e. to obtain the same result as in the previous exercise).
